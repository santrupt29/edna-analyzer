### The Problem: Databases Can't Keep Up

Traditional eDNA analysis pipelines rely on matching sequences to reference databases. For frontier environments like the deep sea, these databases are vastly incomplete, leaving a majority of reads **unassigned**. This isn't just noise‚Äîit's a missed opportunity for discovery.

### Our Solution: Understand DNA's Language

`edna-analyzer` takes a different approach. It uses a **DNA foundation model**‚Äîan AI that has learned the fundamental patterns of DNA sequences. Instead of just "matching words" (exact sequences), it understands the "grammar" and context.

This allows us to:
1.  **Confidently Classify** reads that have a strong semantic similarity to a curated set of known organisms.
2.  **Systematically Discover** what's new by clustering the remaining reads, turning the "unassigned" majority into a prioritized list of candidate novel species.

## Visual Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[FASTQ/FASTA Reads] --> B{1. Preprocess};
    B --> C[Clean Reads];
    C --> D{2. Embed};
    D -- Nucleotide Transformer --> E[Sequence Vectors];
    E --> F{3. Search};
    F -- FAISS ANN Search --> G{Similarity ‚â• œÑ ?};
    G -- Yes --> H[‚úÖ Assigned Taxon];
    G -- No --> I[‚ùì Unassigned];
    I --> J{4. Cluster};
    J -- HDBSCAN --> K[üî¨ Candidate Novel Taxa];
    H & K --> L{5. Report};
    L --> M[üìä Abundance, Diversity & Visuals];

## Core Features

  * **AI-Powered Classification**: Uses `Nucleotide-Transformer` embeddings to capture deep sequence context, providing more robust classification than alignment-based methods.
  * **High-Speed Vector Search**: Employs **FAISS** (`IVF-PQ`) for approximate nearest neighbor search, enabling rapid comparison of millions of reads against our reference index.
  * **Automated Novelty Discovery**: Applies **HDBSCAN**, a powerful density-based clustering algorithm, to group unassigned vectors into high-confidence candidates for new taxa.
  * **Actionable Outputs**: Generates publication-ready tables (`.csv`), biodiversity metrics (`.json`), and interactive visualizations (`.html` with Krona/UMAP).
  * **Reproducible & Accessible**: Fully containerized with **Docker** and accessible via a **FastAPI** backend and a simple web interface.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1\. Docker (Recommended)

Get the full application stack running with a single command.

```bash
# Build and start the services (API, UI, etc.)
docker compose up --build

# ‚û°Ô∏è API is now live at http://localhost:8000
# ‚û°Ô∏è Interactive Docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
# ‚û°Ô∏è Web UI at http://localhost:3000
```

### 2\. Local Python Environment

For command-line use and development.

```bash
# 1. Clone & setup environment
git clone [https://github.com/santrupt29/edna-analyzer.git](https://github.com/santrupt29/edna-analyzer.git)
cd edna-analyzer
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Download model & build index (one-time setup)
python scripts/download_model.py
python scripts/build_index.py --refs anchors/refs_all.fasta --out anchors/ref_index.faiss

# 3. Run a sample analysis
python scripts/run_pipeline.py \
  --input data/sample.fastq \
  --out results/ \
  --tau 0.20
```

  - [ ] **Auto-œÑ Calibration**: Develop a method to automatically recommend an optimal `œÑ` threshold based on the input data's similarity distribution.
  - [ ] **Hybrid Search Index**: Explore HNSW+PQ indexes in FAISS for potentially faster and more accurate search.
  - [ ] **Scalable Workflow**: Port the core logic to Nextflow/Snakemake for seamless execution on HPC and cloud platforms.
  - [ ] **Phylogenetic Placement**: For novel clusters, place the exemplar sequence onto a reference tree to better visualize its evolutionary context.
